C,C++,Java Language:

C:

1.It is platform dependent.
2.It generates .exe and .bak file.
3.The compiler translates the code to machine language.
4.The source file has .c extension.

C++:

1.It is platform dependent.
2.It generates .exe file.
3.The compiler translates the code to machine language.
4.The source file has .cpp extension.

Java:

1.It is platform independent because of byte code.
2.It generates .class file.
3.Java uses compiler and interpreter.
4.The source file has .java extension.

Compiler:

> Compiler is a programme that translates the source code to machine code.


> Java Compiler compile the code and generates the class file.

> Java Programme ==>(source code)

> Compiler converts source code to byte code and generates class file

> JDK(Java Development Kit) contains JRE along with different tools like java libraries,java compilers,debuggers etc.

> JRE and JVM converts the code and genertaes the class file.

JVM(Java Virtual Machine)
 
> It executes the programme line by line so it is called as interpreter.

> JVM has both Compiler and Interpreter.

> Compiler compiles the code and generates the byte code.

> Interpreter converts the byte code to machine language.

> Class loader loads the java programme and genertes .class file.

> Byte code verifer==> Verifies the code is valid or not (or) the code to be in fit state.

> Security Manager is a object that protects the java application. 
 
Java SE:

> It is a programming platform.
> It includes APIs like java.net,java.sql etc

Java EE:
> It is used for develop web and ennterprise application.
> It is advanced edition than Java SE
> It is used commercial pupose.

Java ME:
> It is Micro Edition used for mobile application.


why it is named as JDK, J2SE, Java SE
 
I Think
Change of version numbers
